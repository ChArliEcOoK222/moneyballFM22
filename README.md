### Summary
This is a program which uses data exported using the view and google sheets shown in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqIXVjCdYks&t=13s&ab_channel=Zealand). This data is then imported as a csv file into this program which can then be used to visualise the data and chose players to scout and sign based on statistics.

### What I learned:
- Usage of CSV files in pandas
- Usage of the library soccer mpl
- Python data sorting and visualisation
